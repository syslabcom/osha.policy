VDEX Tools
==========
This egg provides a number of shell scripts that shall support people in
updating vdex definitions. They are meant for developers and have not a lot
of error handling.

cmd_parser
    Tool to parse some excel file for generating command lists for the vdex
    updater. This is error prone and should be avoided

vdex_updater
    Tool to update a vdex file. You should provide a file with a command list
    and the vdex file. The command list is a little dsl that is described below.
    The output will always be stored in the file ./out.xml

xmltoxsl
    This works only with thesaurus files, and gives some statistical information
    about the vdex file. Its output will always be ./out.csv

ordervdex
    This tool takes a vdex file and orders the element according to id.
    It overrides the old xml file!

VDEX UPDATER DSL
================
A line is one command.
A line consists of fields, separated by pipe characters.
The first field is the command.

c = Create
    The next fields contain the new id, the parent id, a caption
    and a description that is currently ignored.
    The new term will be added below the last child if the parent term
    those termIdentifier is lower than the new id. Thus, an ordered
    tree will still be ordered.

u = Update
    The next fields contain the id, the caption and description. The
    description is currently ignored.

m = Move
    The next fields contain the old id, the new id and the new father id.
    The Term gets removed from the old place and added below the father.
    Where it gets added is calculated with the same rules as the Create
    command

d = Delete
    The next field contains the id of the term to be deleted.
