  [thomasw]

  If we are in the root (i. e. not inside a subsite), restrict

  calendar. [thomasw]

-------------------

- Typo fix


1.3.12 (2010-04-19)
-------------------

- Bugfix for a missing import in lc event handler (pilz)


1.3.11 (2010-04-19)
-------------------

- erroneous build


1.3.10 (2010-04-19)
-------------------

- Bugfix for linkchecker patch (pilz)
- workaround for LC problem "Unauthorized: You can't retrieve links for this object."
  The event handler listens for IObjectModified on ALL objects. When the actual object
  has been retrieved and links are added to the LinkDatabse, is also sends a modified event.
  The RetrieveManager tests if the user has the ModifyPortalContent on an object before
  attemting to retrieve. In case of the LinkDatabse, this leads to an Unauthorized for all
  non-managers.
  Our work-araound first tests if a retriever exists for the current object, which is not
  the case for the LinkDatabase (thomasw)


1.3.9 (2010-04-18)
------------------

- registering handlers for ObjectModified and ObjectRemoved, that retrieve or
  unregister links regardless of the link_checker's active state. The registration
  is done with offline=True (thomasw)
- patching linkchecker's _register_urls_at_lms, to make sure url objects
  are re-indexed, and missing url objects in the database don't cause a failure (thomasw)
- patching linkchecker's url.updateStatus so that lastupdate gets written (thomasw)


1.3.8 (2010-03-28)
------------------

- Added two new external methods, for charter PDF generation and for getting
  translated validation messages for HW2010 form validation (jcbrand)

------------------

- Create OSHMail: bugfix, don't reference no longer existing colums (thomasw)
- migrateOshaAdaptation: bugfix and improvement (deroiste)
- Further enhanced the mlparser for the MultilingualThesaurus (gerkern)
- LCRetrieveByDate: bugfixes (pilz)

1.3.6 (2010-03-16)
------------------

- Create oshmail script: merged rows 3,4,5 (col 1) into row 2 (col 1),
  for #873 (thomasw)


1.3.5 (2010-02-28)
------------------

- including required quintagroup.plonecomments, which apparently is a requirement
  for plonecaptchas, but was missing in the site! (thomasw)

1.3.4 (2010-02-28)
------------------

- Create OSHMail template: added new section requested in #784 (thomasw)
- added quintagroup comments and captchas, buildout does not need to install
  products for that any longer (gerken)
- created a custom import step for installing the js files. By having a custom
  import step, we can add dependencies to it, and it turn can ensure that our
  jsregistry is loaded last! (gerken)
- fixed linkchecker export (pilz)
- Updated the subject_accessor patch. For some reason, events have subcategories
  again, so they are part of the patch again. According to #733, RALinks and
  CaseStudies have subcategories again, so they are part of the patch again. (thomasw)

1.3.3 (2010-02-18)
------------------

- Added patch to disable Accept-Range requests in plone.app.blob.field
  (deroiste) #716


1.3.2 (2010-02-17)
------------------

- Added LinkChecker Postgres Importer (pilz)
- Patched getViewActions in Collage. Hardcoded to always return 'view' and 'edit'
  instead of sending huge catalog queries for every single item in the collage.
  Greatly reduces loading speed on the compose page (thomasw)


1.3.1 (2010-02-09)
------------------

- Added the new categories also to the Subcategory vocabulary #463 (thomasw)
- Bugfix in the LinguaPlone_generator_patch.py: import AT_GENERATE_METHOD,
  even though it is not directly referencend in the code, but the ClassGenerator
  from LP.utils depends on it (thomasw)
- allowing update_object_history() from slc.cleanwordpastedtext for untrusted
  code, because it's such a lovely and handy method (thomasw)
- Tested the ExternalMethod for replacing the osha.theme Network
  Member Links portlet with the osha.fop FOP Links portlet (deroiste)

  jquery.dynatree.min.js (deroiste)
- Add external method to migrate the annotatedlinks subtyped docs (jcbrand)

------------------

1.3b1 (2010-01-04)
------------------

- Major refactoring of the adapter/schemaextender.py class. The adapter
  registrations are now all happening in adapter/configure.zcml. This has
  drastically reduced the number of import statements in schemaextender.py.
  Furthermore, a lot of cruft was removed and common code snippets were
  refactored into a common new superclass. (jcbrand)

1.2.30 (2009-12-09)
-------------------

-------------------------------

  the current folder. (jcbrand)

osha.policy 1.2.20 (2009-09-09)
-------------------------------

- replaced several occurrences of parent-fieldname-image ids through classes (pilz)
- added subtyper for Documents to mark them linklist annotatable (pilz)

- removed a pdb statement from ploneflashuploadpatch (thomasw)

osha.policy 1.2.17 (2009-08-12)
-------------------------------
-reverting configure.zcml, which I had forgotten earlier (thomasw)

osha.policy 1.2.16 (2009-08-12)
-------------------------------

- reverted utils.py and handlers.py due to unsolved import/dependency issues (thomasw)

osha.policy 1.2.15 (2009-08-12)
-------------------------------

- For consistency reasons, we also include the "country" field in the
  PressRelease-schemaextender. PressRelease is derived from ATNewsItem, which
  is extended by our TaggingSchemaExtenderDocument. Lately, the
  document-extender has the country field. If a PressRelease doesn't also
  have this field, it can lead to an error when trying to translate it. (thomasw)

  showing up in section A/4 (thomasw)
- Add scripts dir with new script set_pdf_metadata.py (jcbrand)
- Add extractPDFText to utils (jcbrand)

  custom event (jcbrand)

-------------------------------

- re-added the "country" field globally to the TaggingSchemaExtenderDocument (thomasw)

-------------------------------

- REVERTED release 1.2.11 to status of release 1.2.10
  The solution in 1.2.11 was not valid (thomasw)

osha.policy 1.2.11 (2009-08-01)
-------------------------------

- readded the ERO Schema extensions. Part of the problems were due to wrong
  naming of archetypes fields. The fix forces you to delete the ero_target_group
  and the ero_topic index, and call the osha policy create_indexes genericsetup
  step. This step was extracted from the various steps, and it is safe to call
  the step on an already installed site. (gerken)

osha.policy 1.2.10 (2009-07-28)
-------------------------------

- added patch to queuecatalog to make it work with relations (jcbrand)
