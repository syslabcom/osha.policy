osha.policy Changelog
=====================

osha.policy 1.2.14 (2009-08-02)
-------------------------------

- removed the getCountry script. We have a generated accessor with the same name. This can
  lead to wrong results in the catalog's metadata (thomasw)

osha.policy 1.2.13 (2009-08-02)
-------------------------------

- re-added the "country" field globally to the TaggingSchemaExtenderDocument (thomasw)
- added ero_topic and ero_target_group to the OSHAMetadata vdex vocabulary (thomasw)

osha.policy 1.2.12 (2009-08-01)
-------------------------------

- REVERTED release 1.2.11 to status of release 1.2.10
  The solution in 1.2.11 was not valid (thomasw)

osha.policy 1.2.11 (2009-08-01)
-------------------------------

- readded the ERO Schema extensions. Part of the problems were due to wrong
  naming of archetypes fields. The fix forces you to delete the ero_target_group
  and the ero_topic index, and call the osha policy create_indexes genericsetup
  step. This step was extracted from the various steps, and it is safe to call
  the step on an already installed site. (gerken)
